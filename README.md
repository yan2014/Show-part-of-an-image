# Show-part-of-an-image
It uses slider to control the visible part of an image

The original design is: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/arctic-sea-ice-is-losing-its-bulwark-against-warming-summers.

In order to realize a similar design, I tried to search for libraries to do it but failed to do so. Then I came up with a simple solution using slider.
